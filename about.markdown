# Intro

Hi! I'm Yiannis, a Data Engineer from Greece. I have a BSc in Computer Science, a MSc in Machine Learning/Signal Processing and I have been working in the software industry as a Data Engineer for 2 years.  

 Below is a link to my GitHub profile. Be warned that some code in there is a bit ancient, from my university days. I try to regularly update it.

# What this blog is about

I saw GitHub Pages as an opportunity to blog about my interests, and for documenting various ideas and things I have 
been trying. These concern Data Engineering, coding in general, the tech industry, and sometimes other topics as well. Needless 
to say, whatever is written in this site is mostly based on my personal views and experiences, but when needed, I will back up bold statements by facts. 

## LLM/AI Disclaimer

Unless otherwise stated, you can assume that **all the material in here is written by me and not auto-generated from a LLM**. For code snippets and my personal projects I do consult AI assistance from time to time, but I usually find that the solutions LLMs provide either are not optimal, or simply do not work at all (try consulting a LLM on optimizing Rust code or Postgres, for example :) ).  

 I consider tools based on LLMs powerful for things like quick POCs or experimenting, but we're far from them ever replacing humans, if at all.
